# CRUD ANGULAR NEST

## Welcome to the full stack angular nest

CRUD ANGULAR NEST is a set of Open Source components that together, provide an end-to-end framework for building dynamic web applications; starting from the top (code running in the browser) to the bottom (database). The stack is made up of:

- **M**ongoDB : Document database – used by your back-end application to store its data as JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) documents
- **N**est (sometimes referred to as Nest.js): Back-end web application framework running on top of Node.js
- **A**ngular : Front-end web app framework; runs your JavaScript code in the user's browser, allowing your application UI to be dynamic
- **N**ode.js : JavaScript runtime environment – lets you implement your application back-end in JavaScript
